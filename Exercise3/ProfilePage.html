		The Fremesis was born of nothing. It lives only because I do. It strives only to return to whence it came. You see the problem here. 
		If its containment is ever jeopardized, efforts must be turned towards directing it away from the planet. Above all else, it must never be allowed to catch up with me. 
		Partly this is because I don't like it. It gives me the creeps. Floating all smugly like that.
		The main reason however is that due to it being my exact opposite, it is composed of antimatter rather than matter. 
		Were it to come into contact with me (or any other matter, for that matter) both objects would be annihilated, producing enough energy in the process to destroy three Earths.
